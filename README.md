This is a final project for SoftUni. 
It is a fantasy football-like site where you can assemble your team, win points based on players' real-life performances, and compare yourself with other people.
Additionally it has a news section where you can read the latest football news.
For the admins of the site, it provides the ability to write news or delete them. They can delete users and are the ones who assign scores to players based on their real-life performance.
